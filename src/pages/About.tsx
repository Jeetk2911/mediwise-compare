              <li>
                <strong>Background:</strong> Online medicine shopping has grown significantly, but users often 
                struggle with comparing prices and availability across multiple platforms. Many face 
                delays and increased costs due to the lack of a unified comparison tool.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Objective:</strong> The goal of MediCompare is to provide users with an easy-to-use platform 
                to compare medicine prices, check availability, and suggest alternative medicines of 
                stockouts.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Scope:</strong> MediCompare will target users in India, focusing on price comparison, 
                availability tracking, and alternative medicine suggestions across multiple online 
                pharmacies and e-commerce sites.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Significance:</strong> This project aims to improve accessibility, affordability, and convenience 
                for users, ultimately helping them make informed and cost-effective healthcare 
                decisions.

            <ul className="space-y-4 list-disc pl-6">
              <li>
                <strong>Review of existing work:</strong> Services such as GoodRx and 1mg have made it easier 
                for people to compare medicine prices and check availability through their tools. 
                Moreover, studies underline the impact of medications in cutting down healthcare 
                expenses with research indicating potential cost reductions of up to 80% upon 
                transitioning from branded to generic drugs (as reported by the World Health 
                Organization in 2020).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Comparative analysis:</strong> Though current platforms excel enough in some aspects, 
                they can be somewhat restricted in their reach and capabilities at times for instance 
                GoodRx excels in price comparisons but does not provide alternative suggestions 
                for cheaper medications, limiting user flexibility.
